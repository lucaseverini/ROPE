Link.f90            A linker for output from autocoder

tapedump.f90        A filter that dumps the "object tape" from the -t
                    option with word marks.  See the Write_Tape
                    subroutine in pass_3_m.f90.

to_simh.f90         Convert the "object tape" to run in simh; uses
                    stream output, which didn't exist in f95.  It
                    provides traditional SimH, Pierce A and H, and
                    Icelandic encodings. The Makefile doesn't make
                    this one as to_simh, but it can be made as
                    to_simh_f.  "make all" doesn't do this.

to_simh_direct.f90  Convert the "object tape" to run in simh; uses
                    direct-access output to fake stream output, which
                    didn't exist in f95.  This works on many
                    systems.  The Makefile doesn't make this one, but
                    it can be made as to_simh_d.  "make all" doesn't
                    do this.

to_simh.c           Convert the "object tape" to run in simh; uses C
                    stream I/O; should work on essentially all systems.
                    It only provides Pierce A and H encodings. 

to_e11.f90          Convert the "object tape" to run in simh; uses
                    unformatted Fortran output, which is coincidentally
                    exactly what simh wants on many little-endian systems.
                    This doesn't pad odd-length records, so use
                      set mt1 FORMAT=E11
                    before booting.
