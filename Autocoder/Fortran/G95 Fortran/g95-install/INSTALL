How to install g95:

1) Unpack the downloaded tarball (e.g. g95-x86-linux.tgz) in a directory
of your choice:

   tar -zxvf g95-x86-linux.tgz

2) For your convenience, you can create another symbolic link from a
directory in your $PATH (e.g. ~/bin) to the executable

   ln -s $PWD/g95-install/bin/*g95* ~/bin/g95

You should now be able to run g95 and create executables.


To get a list of environment variables that control the library, run a
compiled binary with the --g95 option, ie:

  ./a.out --g95

   Have Fun!
